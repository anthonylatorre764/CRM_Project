I was tasked with adding the background image as well as site functionality. 

My Added Lines Of Code In HTML


<img class="resize" src="Group-15.png"/>

<div class="links">

<a href="http://Facebook.com"><span id="bluebutton1">Facebook</span></a>

<a href="https://twitter.com/"><span id="bluebutton1">Twitter</span></a>

<a href="https://www.google.com/"><span id="bluebutton1">Google</span></a>

 <a href="https://www.indeed.com/"><span id="bluebutton1">Indeed</span></a>
    </div>
    

My Added Lines Of Code In CSS

.resize {
    width: 300px;
    height: auto;
}

.resize {
    width: 473px;
    height: auto;
}

.resize {
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

.links {
    position: absolute;
    right: 100px;
    width: 400px;
}

Other added changes were made to the radius of the blue background to get the shape closer to the original picture.

    border-radius:0% 90% 85% 12% / 10% 0% 100% 3%; 


I also added;

    transition-duration: 0.3s;
    display:block;
    
to .sign-up-btn.

Along with adding functioning social media links and properly aligning them on the page with css.

.links {
    position: absolute;
    right: 100px;
    width: 400px;
}
